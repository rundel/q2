///
/// Consumers reading a profile from disk must check this and reject on
/// mismatch. Bump whenever the serialized shape changes in a way that
/// a v1 consumer would misread — including adding a required field,
/// renaming a field, or changing the semantics of an existing field.
///
/// **Version history:**
/// - `1`: Initial Phase-0 shape.
/// - `2`: Phase-8 (`bd-r82e`). Adds `includes` (transitive include set),
///   `nav_dependencies` (user-declared cross-doc edges),
///   `always_render` (per-doc Pass-2 opt-out), and
///   `body_link_targets` (Pass-1-resolved cross-doc body link set).
/// - `3`: `bd-o8pr`. Adds `resources` (document-level `resources:`
///   patterns from frontmatter; the post-render collector expands).
/// - `4`: `bd-n8a4` (listings epic, L0). Adds `listing_item:
///   ListingItemInfo` for the listings feature surface (curated typed
///   fields plus `extra: BTreeMap<String, ConfigValue>` for custom
///   templates) and `categories_raw: Option<ConfigValue>` so listing
///   consumers can apply tag-aware merging via `MergedConfig` when
///   combining top-level and listing-item categories.
/// - `5`: `bd-xbnf` (listings epic, L6). Adds `listing_content_globs:
///   Vec<String>` — the unresolved glob strings declared on the host
///   page's `listing.*.contents:`. The dependency-graph builder
///   expands these at graph-build time to add forward edges from each
///   listing host to its content files, so Mode B (`quarto render
///   posts/foo.qmd`) automatically pulls in listing hosts when any of
///   their content files are targeted.
/// - `6`: `bd-c1et2`. Changes `resources` from `Vec<String>` to
///   `Vec<RawResourcePattern>` so each pattern carries its YAML
///   `SourceInfo`. Diagnostics for out-of-project / invalid-glob /
///   glob-walk errors can now render an Ariadne span pointing at the
///   offending scalar. v5 serialized profiles will fail to
///   deserialize at the field level; cached frozen profiles need to
///   be regenerated.
