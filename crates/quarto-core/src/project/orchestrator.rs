 */

//! Project orchestration.
//!
//! # Two passes
//!
//! The driver ([`ProjectPipeline`]) runs every file in a project
//! through **two passes**:
//!
//! - **Pass 1** advances each file as far as
//!   [`DocumentProfileStage`](crate::stage::DocumentProfileStage) —
//!   parse + metadata merge only. Pass 1 extracts each file's
//!   [`DocumentProfile`](crate::document_profile::DocumentProfile),
//!   collecting the full `Vec` into a
//!   [`ProjectIndex`](super::index::ProjectIndex).
//! - **Pass 2** runs the full per-file render, with the Pass-1
//!   `ProjectIndex` available on
//!   [`StageContext::project_index`](crate::stage::StageContext).
//!   Phase-1 stages do not consume it; Phase-2+ (sidebar generate,
//!   cross-doc link rewriting) will.
//!
//! Between the two passes, the project's [`ProjectType`]
//! implementation runs its `pre_render` hook. After Pass 2 it runs
//! `post_render`.
//!
//! # Pass-2 resumption (v1)
//!
//! Phase 1 v1 re-runs the head pipeline inside Pass 2. This wastes a
//! parse + metadata-merge per file versus resuming from the cloned
//! `PipelineData::AtProfile`. The re-work is accepted for v1 because
//! it keeps the CLI rewiring scoped to *orchestration* — threading a
//! pre-built `AtProfile` through `render_document_to_file` is a
//! separate refactor.  A follow-up beads issue tracks the
//! optimization.
