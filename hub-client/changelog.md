### 2026-05-21

- [`6c84696d`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/6c84696d): Login screen and post-logout view now respect the saved `colorScheme` preference (and system `prefers-color-scheme`) instead of always rendering light on first visit and inheriting the previous session's class after logout.

### 2026-05-15

- [`e9399093`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/e9399093): Authorship pill in the replay bar now animates with a rotating rainbow border while attribution data is being generated, so large documents give visible feedback that work is happening before the colours appear in the preview.
- [`52281655`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/52281655): Authorship toggle moved from Settings → Preview to a pill in the replay bar (flush-right, visible in both collapsed and expanded states), and is no longer persisted — it resets on reload. Activation drops from three clicks to one; semantic grouping matches the rest of the per-actor UI in the replay drawer.
- [`70016298`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/70016298): `--attribution=git` HTML renders now derive author colours from Paul Tol's "Muted" 10-colour qualitative palette (colour-blind safe across red-green and blue-yellow deficiencies, perceptually uniform brightness on white) instead of an unconstrained HSL hue. CLI HTML output only — hub-client previews continue to colour authors from Automerge profile metadata.

### 2026-05-14

- [`8b8349c8`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/8b8349c8): `--attribution=git` renders now auto-inject a viewer CSS/JS pair (dotted underline, body text painted in the author's colour, hover badge) so static HTML matches the hub-client preview. The shared stylesheet lives at `resources/attribution/viewer.css` (single source of truth with the CLI), loaded into the hub-client via a virtual-module Vite plugin.

### 2026-05-13

- [`38273485`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/38273485): Authorship colouring and the hover badge now appear on q2-preview documents, matching q2-debug. The shared badge/stylesheet moved to `framework/`; q2-preview's dispatchers wrap nodes on hit and `PreviewDocument` mounts the hover handlers.
- [`5194cc59`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/5194cc59): Thread the Authorship payload through the q2-preview WASM entry point so attribution data reaches the AST iframe. Off-path the call is byte-identical to before via the new `render_page_in_project_with_attribution` wrapper.

### 2026-05-12

- [`7ceb42c0`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/7ceb42c0): Fix a race where Authorship colouring failed to appear on first render in q2-debug for files using `render-components`. The iframe now serializes AST updates through the in-flight component-load promise, so two updates queued during load run in arrival order.
- [`8cf443c1`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/8cf443c1): Add a Settings → Preview → Authorship toggle. When on, the q2-debug renderer colours each node by its last-touch Automerge actor (or git author for `--attribution=git` renders) and shows a hover badge with the author's name and a relative timestamp. Off by default; the wire path stays cold.
- [`10dd3cfc`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/10dd3cfc): Port the Authorship renderer-side colouring to the new framework/ + q2-debug/ split (Plan 2pre). Attribution data flows through the framework's `AttributionLookupContext`; q2-debug's Block/Inline dispatchers do the wrap and the format's `AstRenderer` handles the hover badge.
- [`91cfe944`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/91cfe944): `usePreference` is now cross-instance reactive — toggling a preference in Settings updates sibling consumers like the preview without a manual page refresh.

### 2026-05-10

- [`68e5ec24`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/68e5ec24): Custom syntax highlighting now works in Quarto Hub projects (bd-izfv) — user-supplied tree-sitter grammars under `_quarto/grammars/<lang>/` now apply to code blocks even when the qmd file lives under a `_quarto.yml` ancestor, matching the single-file render path.
- [`915f1a3a`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/915f1a3a): New `format: q2-preview` drives the live preview through the q2-preview pipeline — shortcodes, Lua filters, sectionize, crossref, sidebar/navbar metadata, embedded image artifacts, footnote numbering, and appendix structure. Renders through the iframe alongside q2-debug. Read-only in v1: component-driven edits (kanban drag, future comment buttons) silently no-op with a console warning.
- [`eb07797b`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/eb07797b): Fix iframe-host crash when typing `render-components:\n  -` (empty list bullet) into a document's YAML frontmatter; empty entries are now skipped silently.

### 2026-05-05

- [`5ecdfe48`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/5ecdfe48): Surface doctemplate diagnostics (e.g. `Q-10-2 Undefined variable`) through `quarto render` and the hub-client preview (bd-xdnk). Custom templates referencing undefined variables now produce ariadne-rendered warnings with accurate source locations instead of being silently dropped. Also fixes a separate pre-existing bug where the `template:` YAML key was ignored under `quarto render` because the lookup didn't handle `PandocInlines`-shaped scalars.

### 2026-05-01

- [`2441ad8d`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/2441ad8d): Fix bd-lnd3 — cross-document link clicks now switch the editor in website projects. The website pipeline rewrites `[About](about.qmd)` to `/.quarto/project-artifacts/about.html`; the iframe click handler reverse-maps that back to the source file for in-editor navigation.
- [`c8dcbcf6`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/c8dcbcf6): Hide the floating sidebar below the `lg` (992px) breakpoint instead of letting it collapse to a 26px-wide ghost column at half-pane previews and 768–991px viewports
- [`f8234d00`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/f8234d00): Fix bd-f5yi — narrow the iframe `nav[role="doc-toc"]` hide override to `:not(.sidebar-navigation)` so the website sidebar isn't collateral-killed by the TOC-hiding rule
- [`d656559a`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/d656559a): Surface sibling-page Pass-1 failures in the preview overlay with source-file attribution (bd-rqba), plus rename the misleading "references unknown document" warning to "references missing document information for"
- [`0f103490`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/0f103490): Surface active-page parse errors in the preview overlay (bd-mwtf) and add a dev-only `window.quartoDebug` console API for scripting projects from DevTools (bd-2rv8)

### 2026-04-30

- [`2859733b`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/2859733b): Harden silent auth refresh — buffer extended from 5 to 15 minutes to absorb background-tab timer throttling, and a coalesced `triggerRefresh()` lets callers recover from mid-session 401s without logout

### 2026-04-29

- [`dcac202d`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/dcac202d): Fix replay drawer toggle so clicking the chevron or title closes the drawer

### 2026-04-28

- [`a3ef5e8f`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/a3ef5e8f): Phase 9 sub-phases 9.3–9.4 — `renderToHtml` now drives the new `render_page_in_project` WASM entry point so the live preview renders the active page in the context of its surrounding project (sidebar, navbar, prev/next, cross-doc link rewriting, deduplicated theme CSS); single-file projects fall through to the same path `renderQmd` used to take, so behavior is byte-identical there. `Preview` now re-renders on any sibling-file edit (Decision 6) by depending on the `fileContents` Map identity threaded through `PreviewRouter`.

### 2026-04-24

- [`542a1686`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/542a1686): Defer remote edit application and presence notifications while the tab is hidden to avoid replay-animation on refocus

### 2026-04-22

- [`b0c84210`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/b0c84210): Remote cursor/selection tracking switched from custom OT offset transforms to Automerge cursors anchored on `['text']` — presence stays correct under concurrent edits without the transformOffset / same-line-guard machinery

### 2026-04-21

- [`b0366d07`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/b0366d07): Phase 4.5 UI wiring (bd-n7x2) — Preview's render loop now actually passes the project file list + content resolvers into `renderToHtml`\'s user-grammars option, so auto-discovery fires on every render from the real UI (the previous commit wired the service layer; this connects it to the component tree)
- [`2653d6ca`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/2653d6ca): Phase 4.5 of syntax-highlighting (bd-n7x2) — hub-client auto-discovers user-defined tree-sitter grammars from `_quarto/grammars/<name>/` (containing a `.wasm` + `highlights.scm`); `renderToHtml` grows an optional `userGrammars` option that runs discovery + cache-backed loading before each render so dropping a grammar into the project highlights matching code blocks without any further user action
- [`d3b051c3`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/d3b051c3): Phase 4.3 of syntax-highlighting (bd-n7x2) — `JsUserGrammars` wasm-bindgen bridge; `renderQmd` / `renderQmdContent` grow an optional `userGrammars` parameter so hub-client can route code-block highlighting through JS-side `web-tree-sitter` grammars before falling back to built-ins (wire-up to project discovery is Phase 4.5)
- [`896a676d`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/896a676d): Phase 4.2 of syntax-highlighting (bd-n7x2) — adds `web-tree-sitter`-based user-grammar highlighter (`loadUserGrammar` in `src/services/userGrammarHighlight.ts`); infrastructure-only, not yet wired into the render path (Phase 4.3 + 4.5 land the wasm-bindgen bridge and hub-client auto-discovery)
- [`b0177b8d`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/b0177b8d): Generic file uploader — any binary asset (images, PDFs, `.wasm` grammars, data files, fonts) can now be added to a project via the new "Upload" button in the file sidebar, drag-drop onto the sidebar (destination derived from drop target), or drag-drop into the editor; destination paths validated against leading `/`, `.`/`..` segments, and forbidden characters

### 2026-04-20

- [`23e020cd`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/23e020cd): CSS cache now invalidates automatically on any Rust-side SCSS-assembly change — replaces the manual `_vN` version knob with a build-time hash of quarto-sass source files
- [`2824fceb`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/2824fceb): Syntax-highlight color rules now reach users whose browsers had cached the pre-fix default CSS (cache-key version bump; previously only affected users with warm IndexedDB state)
- [`f57a8fef`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/f57a8fef): Fix Firefox Quirks Mode in preview iframe — stylesheets (including the new syntax-highlight colors) now apply correctly in Firefox, not just Chrome
- [`981bda93`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/981bda93): Documents without an explicit `theme:` entry now ship the built-in syntax-highlight color rules, matching native `quarto render` behavior
- [`2dfd24a0`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/2dfd24a0): Syntax highlighting for code blocks now works in the hub-client preview (12 built-in languages: bash, css, html, javascript, json, julia, lua, python, r, sql, typescript, yaml)

### 2026-04-17

- [`123ea422`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/123ea422): Show cross-referenceable elements (figures, tables, theorems, equations, ...) in the document outline, with rendered labels like "Figure 1: caption" and absorbing inner theorem headers so they don't appear twice

### 2026-04-16

- [`ee5d8ca0`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/ee5d8ca0): Reconcile orphan IDB projects into the synced project set so share-link visits reliably appear in the project list and re-adding via Connect is idempotent
- [`5c45260a`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/5c45260a): Suppress noisy 'lua error' panic stack traces in the browser console (expected Lua control flow no longer reaches console.error)
- [`26110945`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/q2/commits/26110945): Add Automerge debugger entry at /debug.html with Server and Local IndexedDB modes
